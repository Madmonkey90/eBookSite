        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Our Terms & Conditions Explain:

        <ul>
          <li><p>What information we collect and why we collect it.</p></li> 
          <li><p>How we use that information.</p></li>
          <li><p>The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.</p>
        </ul>

              <p>
              <h4> Information We Collect </h4>
              <p> We collect information to provide better services to all of our users - from 
                  figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like 
                  which ads you will find most useful or the people who matter most to you online.    
                </p>
              <ul>  
              <p> We collect information in two ways: </p>
                <li><p> Information you give us. For example, many of our services require you to sign
                        up for a LFOM Account. When you do, we'll ask for personal information, like 
                        your name, email address, telephone number or credit card. If you want to take 
                        full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a 
                        publicly visible LFOM Profile, which may include your name and photo
                    </p></li>
                <li><p> Information we get from your use of our services. We may collect information about
                        the services that you use and how you use them, like when you visit a website that 
                        uses our advertising services or you view and interact with our ads and content. 
                        This information includes:
                    </p></li>
                </ul>  

                <h4> How Your Information Is Used </h4>
                <ul>
                   <li><p> We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, 
                           protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect LFOM and our users. 
                           We also use this information to offer you tailored content - like giving you more
                           relevant search results and ads. 
                       </p></li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4> Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information </h4>
                <p> Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information </p>
                <ul>
                   <li><p> If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete
                           it - unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. 
                           When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we 
                           can act on your request.
                       </p></li>    
                   <li><p> We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical 
                           effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), 
                           risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning
                           information residing on backup systems).
                       </p></li>
                   <li><p> Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it 
                           would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects
                           information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information
                           from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may 
                           not remove information from our backup systems.
                       </p></li>
